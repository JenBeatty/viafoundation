    	<h2>Who We Are</h2>
    
    	<hr>
    
    	<br />

        <p>The Via Foundation is a nonprofit organisation dedicated to saving lives in 
    schools, communities, and organisations nationwide. By raising funds, 
    managing, and implementing complete long-term <a href="#" title="">automated external defibrillator</a> 
    (AED) programs in our communities, The Via Foundation will increase the survival 
    rate from sudden cardiac arrest (SCA). Currently, the national average survival 
    rate from SCA is 75%. SCA kills more Americans each year than breast cancer, 
    lung cancer,prostate cancer, and AIDS combined.
        </p>

        <br />

        <p>Once in cardiac arrest, the only treatment is a shock to the heart. While 
    bystanders wait for emergency medical services (EMS) to arrive, they can 
    begin to assist the victim by <a href="#" title="">taking control with CPR and an AED.</a>
        </p>

        <br />

        <p>An AED is a small, portable, easy-to-use device that is FDA-approved for use 
    by the lay rescuer. An AED talks the rescuer through a few simple steps, 
    then analyzes the patient and determines if a shock is needed. Only if itâ€™s 
    deemed necessary will the AED prompt the rescuer to press a button emitting 
    a shock. (*Note not all AED units require a button be pushed. Some units emit 
    a shock automatically, if deemed necessary.) There is no way to override an 
    AED and no way to hurt someone with an AED.
